## Typescript

TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScripts features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScripts type system.

For example, JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesnt check that youve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

Types by Inference
TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
